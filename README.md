# Simple-Banking-System-Python-Program
A Python program that models a simple banking system using object-oriented programming concepts

# Problem Statement 1
Create a Python program that models a simple banking system using object-oriented programming concepts. Define a class called "BankAccount" that represents a bank account with attributes such as account number, account holder name, and balance. Implement methods to deposit, withdraw, and display the account balance.

# Problem Statement 2
Next, create a subclass called "SavingsAccount" that inherits from the BankAccount class. Add an additional attribute called "interest_rate" to represent the interest rate applicable to the savings account. Implement a method to calculate and add interest to the account balance.

# Problem Statement 3
Finally, create instances of the BankAccount and SavingsAccount classes, and demonstrate the functionality of the program by performing transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, and interest calculations.

# Problem Statement 4
2.Extend the banking system program to include a third class called "LoanAccount." This class should represent a loan account with attributes such as loan amount, interest rate, and repayment period. Implement methods to calculate the monthly installment amount and display the remaining balance.

Create instances of the LoanAccount class and demonstrate the functionality of the program by calculating monthly installments, making repayments, and displaying the remaining balance.

Note: You can assume simple interest calculations for the purposes of this challenge.

Remember to apply appropriate principles of inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism in your implementation. Test your program with different scenarios to ensure its accuracy and functionality.
